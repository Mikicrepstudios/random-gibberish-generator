# Random Gibberish Generator
#### Something random
- By Mikicrep

I made this cuz im bored and i love wasting time generating random gibberish and seeing can i find actual word or good string inside of it

## Compiling and running:
1. Clone this repo
2. Give yourself permissions to run `compile.sh` (`chmod +x compile.sh`)
3. Run outputted file `./output`

## Search.sh
- This is basically script with one command which searches file for specific word and outputs it and line number

Flags:
- -s string - search for specific string
- -f filename - file to search
