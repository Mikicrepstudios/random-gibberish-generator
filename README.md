#### Something random
- By Mikicrep

I made this cuz im bored and I love wasting time generating random gibberish and seeing if I can find actual word inside of it

## Installing
If you are on arch linux you can just do

`paru -S random-gibberish-generator` - AUR Method

For other distros follow steps below

## Compiling and running:
1. Clone this repo
2. Add execute permission `compile.sh` (`chmod +x compile.sh`)
3. Run outputted file `./output`

This is basically script which searches file for specific word and outputs it and line number
